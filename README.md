# Drip-store
This is my own coded drip store E-commerce platform for selling all types of drip and designer wear. I have coded this website in Bootstrap 5.
### Main Project Idea
I coded this drip store E-commerce website in order to learn how to use bootstrap components that have been documented in the Bootstrap 5 documentation.
### What I have learned so far
I have learned how to download and set up bootstrap in my project as my first thing before coding anything. This can be done through the use of the bootstrap CDN link and the javaScript CDN link for interactivity.
Here are the CDN links
```Bootstrap CDN link
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcQTwFspd3yD65VohhpuuCOmLASjC" crossorigin="anonymous">
```
```JavaScript CDN link
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-MrcW6ZMFYlzcLA8Nl+NtUVF0sA7MsXsP1UyJoMp4YLEuNSfAP+JcXn/tWtIaxVXM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
The Bootstrap CDN link is placed right before any stylesheets in the head section in order for the bootstrap to load first on windowLoad.
The javaScript CDN link is placed in the body section right after the code just before closing the body tag.
I have learned how to use bootsrap navigation bars, carousels, cards for layout of the products and also used bootsrap helper classes to apply the colors using the "bg-" helper class.
### What I am currently learning and focusing on
I am currently focusing on building E-commerce websites and using Bootstrap to create the website layouts and javaScript for interactivity in the website. 
I am looking forward to becoming an expert in this area since its my passion and purpose while coding.
